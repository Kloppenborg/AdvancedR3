# AdvancedR3:

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project is for me to learn how to collaborate and generate
automated pipelines using Rstudio as analysis tool. The project will use
the NMR-omics data.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: Contains cleaned lipidomics data "lipidomics.csv". and a
    "README.md" file
-   `doc/`: A learning document, for testing functions. "egne noter"
    describing some of the steps for setting op an R project for
    collaborative work
-   `R/`:Functions.R,

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
